Placement Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict a student's placement status based on academic performance, extracurricular activities, and skill development metrics. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, SVM, and XGBoost, were used to analyze and classify the likelihood of a student securing a placement.

Data Processing and Feature Engineering
The dataset consists of multiple features such as CGPA, internships, projects, certifications, aptitude test scores, soft skills rating, and placement training participation. Missing values were handled, and feature importance analysis was performed to remove less significant attributes. Additional features like total marks and experience score were created to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power.

Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and different classification models were trained. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was applied to improve accuracy. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%.

Visualization and Insights
Boxplots were used to detect outliers in numerical features.
Count plots helped analyze the distribution of placement status based on various attributes.
Correlation heatmaps and pair plots revealed relationships between features.
Confusion matrices and ROC curves were generated to evaluate model performance.
Results & Findings
Aptitude test scores, soft skills, and total marks significantly influence placement chances.
Internships and projects improve placement likelihood, though they are not the only deciding factors.
Ensemble models like Random Forest and AdaBoost outperformed simpler models like Logistic Regression.
Future Enhancements
Integration of deep learning models to enhance accuracy.
Expansion of the dataset with additional student attributes.
Implementation of automated feature selection for better generalization.
This project provides a data-driven approach to predicting student placements, offering valuable insights for students, educators, and career counselors.
